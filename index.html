          <p>I'm taking the Mobile Friendly Websites course to learn more about programming! I want to fill up my toolbox with enough tools to land myself a job in the tech industry. With the knowledge I obtain here, paired with my B.A. in Mathematics, I hope to one day work in the Silicon Valley. However, I need a lot of experience before I can make the jump to that platform.</p>

          <p>For now, I'm being a patient student, taking my time to properly learn the material. After this, I plan on taking Javascript I and II, then the Self-Teaching Course. Finally, I plan on getting into the Cohort, and excelling. From there, we'll see what opportunities arise.</p>
